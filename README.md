## Flutter Shop

Welcome to Flutter Shop, my first project on the exciting journey of learning Dart and exploring the Flutter framework. This project represents my efforts to dive into mobile app development, experimenting with new concepts and applying the skills acquired along the way.

## Project Overview

Flutter Shop is a simple mobile app designed to showcase the fundamentals of Dart programming language and Flutter framework. The app simulates a basic shopping experience with features like product listing, detail view, and a shopping cart.

## Learning Goals

1. **Dart Language**: Gain proficiency in Dart, the programming language used to develop Flutter applications.

2. **Flutter Framework**: Explore the Flutter framework and understand its building blocks such as widgets, state management, and navigation.

3. **UI/UX Design**: Experiment with designing user interfaces, creating visually appealing layouts, and ensuring a smooth user experience.

4. **API Integration**: Learn how to fetch and display data from an API, simulating a real-world scenario for a product catalog.

5. **State Management**: Implement various state management techniques to efficiently handle the application's state.

6. **Navigation**: Understand and implement navigation between different screens within the app.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure with distinct directories for different aspects of the app:
